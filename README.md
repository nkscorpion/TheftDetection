# TheftDetection
In here I try to make a simple theft detection based on background subtraction (with learning rate almost 0) and connected component labeling/blob detection. The cons of my implementations are: -too sensitive with light-changing and; -it will detect not only the missing object but accidentally new object that appeared there. That's why it should be used on a stable-light area, with all of the object are static object, like garage with no one at home (which is I didn't have that kind of video yet). In this video the stealing is detected when some object is missing for 3 seconds or more.
